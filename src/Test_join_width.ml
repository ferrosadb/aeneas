(** Tests for when a branch point's branches are joined: {!Cps.joins} and
    {!Cps.width_after_branch}.

    Symbolic execution keeps one evaluation context per path and a context holds
    a whole environment, so the number of paths a statement list ends in is what
    a body costs. A branch point contributes two kinds of result: the paths that
    continue to the rest of the block, which are evaluated again there, and the
    ones that have finished -- an early [return], or the [break] a desugared [?]
    error path becomes -- which are carried only so that their result is
    reported.

    Which of the two decides the join used to be a scan of the sub-blocks ("does
    any branch contain a [break] anywhere below it"), and a block's tail is
    where the enclosing loop's own [break] lives. On one crate that scan
    declined to join at all 16476 branch points of a body, leaving 8230 contexts
    in a single statement list of which 8230 - 38 were paths that had already
    finished. The numbers are recorded here because they are what the rule below
    is for: a decision made from the results joins the branch points that can be
    joined, and the arithmetic of the ones that cannot is what a fix has to
    move.

    Note what these checks do *not* claim: a branch point that has finished
    paths and two or more continuing ones is still not joined, because a [Let]
    binds a value and so the symbolic AST cannot carry a [break] in the bound
    expression. Pinning that here keeps the limitation where a reader will find
    it. *)

   With the join the count is linear; without it the continuing paths double and the
   finished ones pile up behind them, which is the 8230-context statement list the finding
   records. Both numbers are pinned so that a change which does not move the second one
   cannot look like it moved the first. *)
