(* Bounds on the parallel translator.

   `parallel_filter_map` schedules every function at once and lets the pool
   decide: on a 16-core host that is 15 workers, each translating a whole Rust
   function. Aeneas already knows each function's size, so a run can be bounded
   by what is in flight instead of by what is queued -- the measured difference
   on a large extracted crate was 8.8+ GiB and climbing versus 2.0 GiB, with the
   cgroup killing the former.

   These cases pin the two bounds independently, because a scheduler that
   respects only one of them still reproduces the failure: capping job count
   does nothing when one function is enormous, and capping cost does nothing
   when the functions are numerous and small.

   Run with `dune build @runtest` from src/. *)
