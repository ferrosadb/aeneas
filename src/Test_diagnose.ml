(* Attribution of translator memory to functions.

   The run this exists for is the one that gets killed: a large extracted crate reached 18.5
   GiB of anonymous RSS and the cgroup took it, and the Gc statistics that aeneas already
   prints said live data was growing while the heap stayed near 1.4x live. That rules out
   the collector but cannot say *which function* is holding the memory, because the report
   is a whole-process gauge.

   Two decisions are pinned here. The line is streamed per function rather than sorted at
   the end, so a run that never reaches its final report still names the last function it
   finished. And attribution forces one worker: with several domains translating at once a
   per-function live-words delta measures the neighbours too.

   Run with `dune build @runtest` from src/. *)
