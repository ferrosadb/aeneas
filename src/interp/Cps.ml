(** Whether a branch point's branches should be joined, from what they ended in.

    [continuing] paths go on to the rest of the block and [exiting] ones have
    finished ([break], [continue], [return] or a panic). Two or more continuing
    paths are worth merging -- the rest of the block is then evaluated once
    instead of once per path -- and a finished path cannot be merged with
    anything. The answers have to come from the results rather than from
    inspecting the sub-blocks: a block's tail holds the enclosing loop's own
    [break], so a syntactic scan says "can leave" about almost every branch
    point in a body that loops or returns, and an over-cautious [No] here is
    paid for by duplicating the rest of the block at every branch.

    [exiting > 0] is a [No] for a reason that is structural rather than
    cautious: joining is a [Let] over the branch expression, and
    {!SymbolicToPureExpressions.translate_let} forbids [break], [continue] and
    [return] in a bound expression. *)
let joins ~(continuing : int) ~(exiting : int) : bool =
  continuing >= 2 && exiting = 0

(** How wide a branch point leaves the rest of the block's input.

    Kept next to {!joins} because it is the same arithmetic seen from the other
    side: a joined branch point hands over one context however many branches it
    had, an unjoined one hands over one per continuing branch, and a finished
    branch hands over a context that is carried but never evaluated. *)
let width_after_branch ~(continuing : int) ~(exiting : int) : int =
  (if joins ~continuing ~exiting then 1 else continuing) + exiting

(** It happens that we need to concatenate lists of results, for instance when
    evaluating the branches of a match. When applying the continuations to build
    the symbolic expressions, we need to decompose the list of expressions we
    get to give it to the individual continuations for the branches. *)
