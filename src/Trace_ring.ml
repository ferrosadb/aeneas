(** A bounded, newest-first trace of values kept for diagnostics.

    A trace exists to be read when something goes wrong, which is exactly when
    the computation is already under stress. Keeping every value it is shown
    turns a bounded computation into an unbounded one: a value can be large (an
    evaluation context holds a whole environment), so an unbounded list grows
    with the number of steps taken rather than with the size of the input, and
    the run dies before the trace is ever printed.

    [push] therefore keeps the newest [capacity] values and drops older ones, so
    the amount retained is independent of how many values were pushed.
    Oldest-first order is available through [to_list], which is what a reader
    wants when printing.

    Nothing is compared on push: the values are typically large, and a
    structural comparison per push would cost more than the memory it saved. *)

(** How many values a trace keeps by default. Large enough to show the shape of
    the last few iterations, small enough that retaining them cannot matter. *)
let default_capacity = 8

(** [push ?capacity x ring] returns [ring] with [x] as its newest value,
    dropping the oldest value once [capacity] values are held. A capacity of
    zero retains nothing, which is the documented way to turn a trace off
    entirely. *)
let push ?(capacity = default_capacity) (x : 'a) (ring : 'a list) : 'a list =
  if capacity <= 0 then []
  else if List.length ring < capacity then x :: ring
  else
    (* Keep the newest [capacity - 1] values after the one being added. Dropping the
       oldest here is what makes retention independent of the number of pushes. *)
    x :: List.filteri (fun i _ -> i < capacity - 1) ring

(** The retained values in chronological order, oldest first. *)
let to_list (ring : 'a list) : 'a list = List.rev ring
