(** Tests for structure sharing in the evaluation environment.

    The synthesis pass keeps one evaluation context per symbolic statement (see
    {!SymbolicAst}), by construction. That is only affordable if a context costs
    the part of the environment which differs from the one it was derived from:
    the environments at a loop fixed point hold every abstraction of the
    function, and a rewrite which rebuilds all of them makes every retained
    context cost a full copy — so the retained memory grows with the size of the
    function times the number of statements, instead of just the number of
    statements.

    These checks pin the contract on the environment-wide map, which is the path
    every context-wide rewrite goes through (destructuring abstractions,
    reducing a context, ending an abstraction, writing through a path): the
    result must share every abstraction the rewrite left alone, and the memory
    the retained result adds must not grow with the number of abstractions.

    All the values involved are immutable, so sharing is observationally
    transparent; the checks below measure it with {!Obj.reachable_words}, which
    counts the blocks reachable from a value once and is therefore what
    retaining that value actually costs. *)

(* --- Forking a context ---------------------------------------------------------

   The arms of a branch point each get a context of their own, derived from the
   one the scrutinee was read in by substituting the value the arm was taken on
   (see {!InterpExpansion}). That derivation is the fork, and it is a different
   path from the rewrites above: a substitution is not an abstraction rewrite, it
   rewrites whichever environment *elements* mention the substituted value.

   What it must cost is the same thing: an arm's context must not be a copy of
   the whole environment, or a branch point that ends in [w] contexts costs [w]
   copies. Substituting one value rewrites a handful of elements -- the binding
   that holds it, and the abstractions whose values mention it -- so the rest of
   the environment has to be the blocks the parent already holds. *)
