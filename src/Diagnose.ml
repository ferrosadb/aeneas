(* Attribution of translator memory to the function that holds it.

   The whole-process [Gc] statistics in [Main] say *that* live data is growing and that the
   collector is not the fault; they cannot say which function is holding it. On a crate
   whose translation is killed at a memory ceiling that is the only question worth asking,
   so these lines are printed as each function finishes: a run that dies before its final
   report still names the last function it completed, and the one after it is the suspect.

   Attribution needs one worker -- with several domains translating at once, a delta
   measures the neighbours too -- which [Parallel.jobs_for_diagnosis] enforces. *)

    total after it, its size and rank, and its name last so the log reads like
    an incident trail. *)

    stands, naming the function it just finished, instead of being killed by a
