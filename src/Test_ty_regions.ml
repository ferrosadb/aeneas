(* Regression tests for [ty_regions].

   [ty_regions] answers one question: which FREE regions does this type mention. A prepass
   rewrites body and variable regions to [RErased] (PrePasses.ml), so after prepasses a type may
   legitimately mention a region that is not free. Aborting on those answers a question the
   caller never asked, and takes the whole run with it.

   A third kind of region is legitimate in a type this collector sees: a bound one, where a
   function item binds the regions of its own arguments ([for<'a> String::as_str<'a>], as it
   appears inside [Map<Iter<String>, …>] once [impl Iterator] has been resolved). The binder is
   part of the type, and its regions are instantiated afresh at every call, so they are not
   regions of this signature either. All three are therefore skipped, and only the free regions
   are reported.

   Run with `dune build @runtest` from src/. *)
