(** Run a filter_map with bounded work in flight.

    [parallel_filter_map] submits every element at once and lets the pool
    decide, so the number of functions being translated simultaneously is the
    pool size no matter how large each one is. On a large Rust crate that
    multiplies the working set of the biggest functions: measured on
    [ferrosa_sstable.llbc] the fifteen-worker run passed 8.8 GiB and was still
    climbing, where the sequential run peaked at 2.0 GiB. Aeneas already knows
    each function's size, so the bound belongs on what is in flight.

    Elements are packed into waves in input order: a wave stops growing at
    [max_jobs] elements or when the sum of their [cost] would pass [budget].
    Each wave is awaited before the next is submitted, so the bound holds at
    every instant, and results keep the input order. An element whose own cost
    exceeds [budget] runs in a wave by itself rather than being dropped. *)

    A worker keeps the symbolic body of the function it is translating alive

    Half of the available memory is the ceiling, so a translator running next to
    a desktop leaves that desktop usable; [cores - 1] is the floor of ambition,
