(** Tests for {!Trace_ring}: a diagnostic trace must not become a leak.

    A trace that keeps every value it is shown turns a bounded computation into
    an unbounded one: the search for a loop fixed point holds one whole
    evaluation environment per retained context, so an unbounded trace grows
    with the number of iterations rather than with the size of the loop. These
    checks pin the contract that makes the trace safe to leave in the code — the
    newest values are kept, older ones are dropped, and the amount retained does
    not depend on how many values were pushed. *)
